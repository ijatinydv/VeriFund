# Fix for User Role Undefined Issue

## Problem
The user's `role` is showing as `undefined` even though they are authenticated, preventing access to role-protected routes like Creator Dashboard.

## Root Cause
The backend API returns a nested response structure:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "token": "...",
    "user": {
      "id": "...",
      "walletAddress": "...",
      "role": "Creator",  // <-- This exists in backend response
      "name": "...",
      "email": "..."
    }
  }
}
```

But the axios interceptor only unwraps one level (`response.data`), so the frontend receives:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "token": "...",
    "user": { ... }
  }
}
```

The frontend code was expecting `{ token, user }` directly, not `{ success, data: { token, user } }`.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated API Functions (✅ DONE)
Modified `frontend/src/services/api.js` to extract the nested `data` field:

```javascript
// Before:
return response.data;

// After:
return response.data || response;
```

This was applied to:
- `getNonce()`
- `loginWithWallet()`
- `updateUserRole()`

### 2. Clear Cached Auth Data (⚠️ USER ACTION REQUIRED)

The user needs to:
1. **Clear localStorage**: Open browser DevTools (F12) → Application → Local Storage → Delete `verifund-auth` and `authToken`
2. **Refresh the page**
3. **Reconnect wallet and sign the message again**

Alternatively, run this in the browser console:
```javascript
localStorage.removeItem('verifund-auth');
localStorage.removeItem('authToken');
location.reload();
```

### 3. For Development: Add Debug Logging (✅ DONE)
Added console logs to `loginWithWallet()` to track the exact response structure.

## Testing Steps

1. Clear localStorage (see step 2 above)
2. Refresh the page
3. Connect wallet
4. Select role (Creator or Investor)
5. Sign the authentication message
6. Check console logs for:
   - `🔍 Login API Response:`
   - `🔍 Response.data.user.role:` should show the role
7. Try accessing Creator Dashboard - should work now!

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. User logs in with wallet
2. Backend returns user object with `role: "Creator"` or `role: "Investor"`
3. Frontend correctly extracts `response.data.user` and stores it in Zustand
4. ProtectedRoute sees `user.role` is defined
5. Access is granted to role-specific pages

## Verification

Check the console logs:
```
ProtectedRoute Check: {
  isAuthenticated: true,
  isLoading: false,
  userRole: "Creator",  // ✅ Should NOT be undefined anymore!
  allowedRoles: ["Creator"],
  userName: "0xcc21e5271cde40a9a921962e71b691698c2a6211"
}
```
