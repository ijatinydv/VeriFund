# Testing the Live AI Re-Scoring Feature

## üß™ Quick Test Guide

Follow these steps to test the complete live re-scoring feature:

## Prerequisites
Make sure all services are running:

### Terminal 1 - AI Service
```bash
cd ai-service
python main.py
# Should show: Running on http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

### Terminal 2 - Backend
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
# Should show: Server running on port 5000
```

### Terminal 3 - Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
# Should show: Local: http://localhost:5173
```

## üéØ Test Scenario 1: Manual Webhook Test

### Step 1: Get Your Project ID
1. Open browser: `http://localhost:5173`
2. Login as a Creator
3. Navigate to Creator Dashboard
4. Open DevTools (F12) ‚Üí Console
5. Type: `localStorage.getItem('token')` to verify you're logged in
6. Look at your projects and note the Project ID (or check MongoDB)

### Step 2: Simulate a GitHub Webhook
Open a new terminal and run:

```bash
# Replace YOUR_PROJECT_ID with actual project ID
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/webhook/github/YOUR_PROJECT_ID \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "ref": "refs/heads/main",
    "head_commit": {
      "message": "feat: add amazing new feature",
      "author": {"name": "Test Developer"},
      "timestamp": "2025-10-13T10:00:00Z"
    },
    "repository": {
      "name": "test-repo",
      "full_name": "user/test-repo"
    }
  }'
```

### Step 3: Watch the Magic! ‚ú®
**Within 5 seconds**, you should see on the Creator Dashboard:

1. ‚úÖ Console log: `üîÑ Score updated: 75 ‚Üí 76.8`
2. ‚úÖ Toast notification appears: "üéâ Your potential score increased by 1.8 points!"
3. ‚úÖ Score number animates smoothly from old to new value
4. ‚úÖ Progress bar updates
5. ‚úÖ Color may change if threshold crossed

## üéØ Test Scenario 2: Different Commit Types

Test with various commit messages:

### Meaningful Commits (Should Increase Score)
```bash
# Feature commit
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/webhook/github/YOUR_PROJECT_ID \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"ref":"refs/heads/main","head_commit":{"message":"feat: new payment integration"},"repository":{"name":"test"}}'

# Bug fix
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/webhook/github/YOUR_PROJECT_ID \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"ref":"refs/heads/main","head_commit":{"message":"fix: resolve authentication bug"},"repository":{"name":"test"}}'

# Refactoring
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/webhook/github/YOUR_PROJECT_ID \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"ref":"refs/heads/main","head_commit":{"message":"refactor: improve code quality"},"repository":{"name":"test"}}'
```

### Non-Meaningful Commits (Should NOT Increase Score)
```bash
# Regular commit without keyword
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/webhook/github/YOUR_PROJECT_ID \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"ref":"refs/heads/main","head_commit":{"message":"update readme"},"repository":{"name":"test"}}'
```

## üéØ Test Scenario 3: Using the Test Script

We've provided a Python test script that sends multiple test commits:

```bash
# Make sure you're in the project root
python test_webhook.py YOUR_PROJECT_ID
```

This will:
- ‚úÖ Check if services are running
- ‚úÖ Send 3 different test commits
- ‚úÖ Show results for each commit
- ‚úÖ Give you instructions for watching the dashboard

## üìä What to Observe

### AI Service Console
You should see:
```
================================================================================
[Webhook] Received GitHub webhook for project: 673ab123456789
================================================================================
[Webhook] Commit message: 'feat: add new dashboard feature'
[Webhook] Branch: refs/heads/main
[Webhook] ‚úì Meaningful commit detected (keyword: 'feat')
[Webhook] ‚úì Score increase calculated: +1.8 points
[Webhook] ‚úì Backend notified successfully
================================================================================
```

### Backend Console
You should see:
```
=== Score Update Received ===
Project ID: 673ab123456789
Score Increase: 1.8
Commit Message: feat: add new dashboard feature
‚úì Score updated: 75 ‚Üí 76.8 (+1.8)
```

### Frontend Browser Console
You should see:
```
üîÑ Score updated: 75 ‚Üí 76.8
```

### Frontend UI
You should see:
1. **Live Updates Active** chip at the top (pulsing green)
2. **Score animation**: Number smoothly transitions over 1.5 seconds
3. **Toast notification**: Green success message appears
4. **Progress bar**: Updates to reflect new score
5. **Color changes**: If score crosses thresholds (60, 80)

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Score Not Updating?

**Check 1: All services running?**
```bash
# Test AI Service
curl http://localhost:8000/

# Test Backend
curl http://localhost:5000/api/integrations/health
```

**Check 2: Project ID correct?**
- Open MongoDB Compass
- Check your projects collection
- Copy the exact `_id` value

**Check 3: Commit message has keywords?**
Meaningful keywords: `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `style`

**Check 4: Browser console for errors?**
- Open DevTools (F12)
- Check Console tab for any errors
- Check Network tab to see if polling is happening

### Animation Not Smooth?

**Check 1: Framer Motion installed?**
```bash
cd frontend
npm list framer-motion
```

**Check 2: Clear browser cache**
- Ctrl + Shift + R (hard refresh)

**Check 3: Check React DevTools**
- Install React DevTools extension
- Verify state updates are happening

## üé¨ Demo Flow for Hackathon

### Setup (Before Demo)
1. Have all 3 terminals open with services running
2. Have browser open with Creator Dashboard
3. Have a terminal ready with curl command (pre-filled with project ID)
4. Have screen sharing ready

### During Demo
1. **Show Dashboard** (5 seconds)
   - "Here's our Creator Dashboard with current potential score of 75"
   - Point out the "Live Updates Active" indicator

2. **Explain Feature** (10 seconds)
   - "When creators push code, our AI analyzes commits and updates their score in real-time"

3. **Execute Webhook** (5 seconds)
   - Switch to terminal
   - Execute curl command
   - "Let's simulate a GitHub push event"

4. **Show Processing** (5 seconds)
   - Show AI Service console
   - "Our AI detected a feature commit"
   - Show score increase calculation

5. **Show Live Update** (10 seconds)
   - Switch back to browser
   - Watch score animate
   - Point out toast notification
   - "No page refresh needed - completely live!"

6. **Highlight Tech** (10 seconds)
   - "Python FastAPI for AI processing"
   - "Node.js backend for data management"
   - "React with Framer Motion for smooth animations"
   - "Real-time polling with 5-second intervals"

**Total Demo Time: ~45 seconds**

## üìà Advanced Testing

### Test Multiple Rapid Commits
```bash
# Send 3 commits quickly
for i in {1..3}; do
  curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/webhook/github/YOUR_PROJECT_ID \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "{\"ref\":\"refs/heads/main\",\"head_commit\":{\"message\":\"feat: feature $i\"},\"repository\":{\"name\":\"test\"}}"
  sleep 1
done
```

Watch the score increase multiple times!

### Test Score Bounds
The score is capped at 100. Try sending many commits to see the limit:
```bash
# Send 20 commits (score should cap at 100)
for i in {1..20}; do
  curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/webhook/github/YOUR_PROJECT_ID \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"ref":"refs/heads/main","head_commit":{"message":"feat: feature"},"repository":{"name":"test"}}'
  sleep 6  # Wait for polling interval
done
```
