# Smart Contract Deployment & Interaction Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the complete implementation of automated smart contract deployment and revenue payout simulation for the VeriFund platform. When a project reaches its funding goal, a unique `VeriFundSplitter` contract is automatically deployed to manage and distribute future revenue to investors.

## Implementation Details

### Part 1: Dynamic Hardhat Deployment Script

**File**: `contracts/scripts/deploy.js`

The deployment script has been modified to accept command-line arguments instead of hardcoded values.

#### Command-Line Arguments

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia \
  --owner <creator_wallet_address> \
  --payees <investor1,investor2,investor3> \
  --shares <share1,share2,share3> \
  --cap <repayment_cap_in_eth>
```

#### Example

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia \
  --owner 0x1234...5678 \
  --payees 0xabcd...ef01,0x9876...5432 \
  --shares 6000,4000 \
  --cap 5.5
```

#### Output

The script outputs **only** the deployed contract address to `stdout`:

```
0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f0bEb1
```

This clean output allows the backend to easily capture the address programmatically.

---

### Part 2: Web3 Service - Contract Deployment

**File**: `backend/src/services/web3.service.js`

#### Method: `deploySplitterContract(project, investments)`

This method orchestrates the deployment process.

**Parameters:**
- `project`: Project document (must have `creator.walletAddress` and `fundingGoalInr`)
- `investments`: Array of Investment documents (must have `investor.walletAddress` and `amountInr`)

**Process:**

1. **Validate Inputs**
   - Ensure project has creator wallet address
   - Ensure investments array is not empty
   - Verify all investors have wallet addresses

2. **Prepare Constructor Arguments**
   - `initialOwner`: Project creator's wallet address
   - `payees`: Array of unique investor wallet addresses
   - `shares`: Array of investment shares in basis points (out of 10,000)
   - `repaymentCap`: 120% of funding goal, converted from INR to ETH

3. **Calculate Shares**
   - Group investments by investor (in case of multiple investments)
   - Calculate each investor's share as basis points (10,000 = 100%)
   - Ensure shares sum to exactly 10,000 by adjusting rounding errors

4. **Execute Deployment**
   - Use Node.js `child_process.exec` to run Hardhat script
   - Pass arguments as command-line flags
   - Set 2-minute timeout for deployment
   - Capture `stdout` to extract contract address

5. **Validate & Return**
   - Validate contract address format (0x followed by 40 hex characters)
   - Return the contract address

**Example Conversion:**

```javascript
// Project funding: ₹1,000,000
// Investor A invested: ₹600,000
// Investor B invested: ₹400,000

// Shares calculation:
// A: (600,000 / 1,000,000) * 10,000 = 6,000 basis points (60%)
// B: (400,000 / 1,000,000) * 10,000 = 4,000 basis points (40%)

// Repayment cap:
// 1,000,000 * 1.2 = 1,200,000 INR
// 1,200,000 / 200,000 (exchange rate) = 6.0 ETH
```

---

### Part 3: Investment Service - Trigger Deployment

**File**: `backend/src/services/investment.service.js`

#### Method: `createInvestment()`

Modified to trigger deployment when funding goal is reached.

**Logic:**

```javascript
// After recording investment and updating project funding
if (project.currentFundingInr >= project.fundingGoalInr && !project.splitterContractAddress) {
  // Fetch all investments with investor details
  const allInvestments = await Investment.find({ project: projectId })
    .populate('investor', 'walletAddress name');
  
  // Populate project creator
  await project.populate('creator', 'walletAddress name');
  
  // Deploy splitter contract
  const contractAddress = await web3Service.deploySplitterContract(project, allInvestments);
  
  // Update project
  project.splitterContractAddress = contractAddress;
  project.status = 'Live';
  await project.save();
}
```

**Error Handling:**

If deployment fails:
- Investment is still recorded (investor's money is tracked)
- Project status remains "Funding"
- Error message is returned to the client
- Manual deployment can be triggered later via admin endpoint

---

### Part 4: Payout Simulation

**File**: `backend/src/services/web3.service.js`

#### Method: `simulatePayout(contractAddress, amountEth)`

Simulates a client payment by sending test ETH to the deployed contract.

**Parameters:**
- `contractAddress`: The deployed splitter contract address
- `amountEth`: Amount of ETH to send (as string, e.g., "0.5")

**Process:**

1. **Validate Inputs**
   - Verify contract address format
   - Validate amount is positive number

2. **Check Wallet Balance**
   - Get deployer wallet balance
   - Ensure sufficient funds for transaction + gas

3. **Send Transaction**
   - Use `wallet.sendTransaction()` with ethers.js
   - Send ETH directly to contract address
   - Contract's `receive()` function accepts the payment

4. **Wait for Confirmation**
   - Wait for transaction to be mined
   - Return transaction details

**Returns:**

```javascript
{
  success: true,
  transactionHash: "0x...",
  blockNumber: 12345678,
  gasUsed: "21000",
  amountSent: "0.5",
  contractAddress: "0x...",
  from: "0x...",
  network: "sepolia",
  explorerUrl: "https://sepolia.etherscan.io/tx/0x..."
}
```

---

### Part 5: Payout Simulation Endpoint

**File**: `backend/src/controllers/project.controller.js`  
**Route**: `POST /api/projects/:projectId/simulate-payout`

#### Request

```json
{
  "amount": "0.5"
}
```

#### Response (Success)

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Successfully sent 0.5 ETH to splitter contract",
  "data": {
    "transactionHash": "0xabcd1234...",
    "blockNumber": 5432109,
    "gasUsed": "21000",
    "amountSent": "0.5",
    "contractAddress": "0x742d35Cc...",
    "explorerUrl": "https://sepolia.etherscan.io/tx/0xabcd1234...",
    "project": {
      "id": "6123abc...",
      "title": "AI-Powered Healthcare Platform",
      "contractAddress": "0x742d35Cc..."
    }
  }
}
```

#### Response (Error)

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Insufficient balance. Have 0.3 ETH, need 0.5 ETH"
}
```

## Database Schema Updates

### Project Model

**File**: `backend/src/models/Project.model.js`

```javascript
splitterContractAddress: {
  type: String,
  trim: true,
  lowercase: true,
  match: [/^0x[a-fA-F0-9]{40}$/, 'Invalid Ethereum contract address format']
}
```

This field stores the deployed contract address once deployment is successful.

### User Model

**File**: `backend/src/models/User.model.js`

The `walletAddress` field already exists and is used as the `initialOwner` for the splitter contract.

---

## Environment Variables

Ensure these are set in `backend/.env`:

```env
# Ethereum Network Configuration
SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=https://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_API_KEY
ALCHEMY_API_KEY=your_alchemy_api_key

# Deployer Wallet (must have Sepolia ETH)
OWNER_PRIVATE_KEY=0x...your_private_key...

# Contract Addresses (if using existing contracts)
CONSENT_REGISTRY_ADDRESS=0x...
SECURITY_TOKEN_FACTORY_ADDRESS=0x...
```

**⚠️ Security Note**: Never commit private keys to version control!

---

## Testing Guide

### 1. Test Contract Deployment

**Scenario**: Create investments until funding goal is reached

```bash
# Step 1: Create a project (as Creator)
POST /api/projects
{
  "title": "Test Project",
  "fundingGoalInr": 100000,
  "category": "Technology"
}

# Step 2: Make investments (as Investors)
POST /api/investments/PROJECT_ID
{
  "amount": 60000
}

POST /api/investments/PROJECT_ID
{
  "amount": 40000  # This should trigger deployment
}

# Step 3: Verify deployment
GET /api/projects/PROJECT_ID
# Check that splitterContractAddress is populated
# Check that status is "Live"
```

### 2. Test Manual Deployment

```bash
# If automatic deployment failed, trigger manually
POST /api/investments/deploy-splitter/PROJECT_ID
```

### 3. Test Payout Simulation

```bash
POST /api/projects/PROJECT_ID/simulate-payout
{
  "amount": "0.1"
}

# Expected: Transaction sent to contract
# Investors can then call release(address) on contract to withdraw
```

### 4. Verify on Etherscan

After deployment or payout:

1. Copy the contract address from response
2. Visit: `https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/<CONTRACT_ADDRESS>`
3. Check:
   - Contract creation transaction
   - Contract balance (after payout)
   - Contract events (PaymentReceived, PaymentReleased)

---

## Investor Withdrawal Process

Once revenue is sent to the contract, investors can withdraw their share:

### Using Etherscan (Web Interface)

1. Go to contract address on Sepolia Etherscan
2. Click "Contract" → "Write Contract"
3. Connect wallet (MetaMask)
4. Find `release(address payable account)` function
5. Enter your wallet address
6. Click "Write" and confirm transaction

### Using Frontend (Future Implementation)

Create a frontend component that calls:

```javascript
const contractABI = [...]; // VeriFundSplitter ABI
const contract = new ethers.Contract(contractAddress, contractABI, signer);

// Check pending payment
const pending = await contract.pendingPayment(userAddress);

// Withdraw
const tx = await contract.release(userAddress);
await tx.wait();
```

## Error Handling

### Common Errors & Solutions

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| "Insufficient funds in deployer wallet" | Deployer wallet has no Sepolia ETH | Get test ETH from Sepolia faucet |
| "Invalid contract address returned" | Hardhat script failed | Check Hardhat config, network status |
| "Shares must sum to 10000" | Rounding error in share calculation | Check share calculation logic |
| "Project creator wallet address not found" | Creator has no wallet | Ensure creator connected wallet |
| "Deployment timeout" | Network congestion | Increase timeout or retry |

---

## Security Considerations

### 1. Access Control

- Only authenticated users can trigger deployment
- Payout simulation should be admin-only in production
- Consider adding role-based access control (RBAC)

### 2. Input Validation

- All wallet addresses are validated against Ethereum address format
- Shares are validated to sum to exactly 10,000 basis points
- Investment amounts are validated to be positive

### 3. Reentrancy Protection

- The VeriFundSplitter contract uses ReentrancyGuard
- Follows Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern
- Pull-over-push withdrawal pattern

### 4. Gas Optimization

- Deployment gas cost: ~1,500,000 gas
- Estimated cost at 20 Gwei: ~0.03 ETH (~$100)
- Ensure deployer wallet has sufficient balance

## Troubleshooting

### Deployment Fails

1. Check deployer wallet balance:
   ```bash
   # In backend console
   const web3Service = require('./src/services/web3.service');
   const balance = await web3Service.getWalletBalance();
   console.log('Balance:', balance, 'ETH');
   ```

2. Verify Hardhat configuration:
   ```bash
   cd contracts
   npx hardhat accounts
   ```

3. Test deployment manually:
   ```bash
   cd contracts
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia \
     --owner 0x... \
     --payees 0x...,0x... \
     --shares 6000,4000 \
     --cap 1.0
   ```

### Payout Fails

1. Verify contract exists on-chain
2. Check wallet balance
3. Ensure contract is not paused
4. Verify gas settings
