# On-Chain Revenue & Withdrawal Implementation

## üéØ Overview

This document describes the implementation of the **On-Chain Revenue and Withdrawal** feature for the VeriFund project. This feature allows creators to view and withdraw their share of revenue from the `VeriFundSplitter` smart contract directly through the Creator Dashboard.

---

## üìã What Was Implemented

### 1. **ABI Configuration**
**File Created:** `frontend/src/abi/VeriFundSplitter.json`

- Extracted the ABI (Application Binary Interface) from the compiled smart contract
- This file enables the frontend to interact with the deployed `VeriFundSplitter` smart contract
- Contains the contract's function signatures and types for type-safe blockchain interactions

### 2. **ProjectRevenueCard Component**
**File Created:** `frontend/src/components/project/ProjectRevenueCard.jsx`

A dedicated Web3-enabled component that handles all blockchain interactions for revenue withdrawal:

#### Key Features:
- **Read Pending Revenue**: Uses `useContractRead` to fetch the creator's pending payment from the smart contract
- **Real-time Updates**: Automatically polls the contract for balance updates
- **Withdrawal Functionality**: Uses `useContractWrite` with proper transaction preparation
- **Transaction Monitoring**: Tracks transaction status from submission to confirmation
- **User Feedback**: Provides clear toast notifications for all transaction states
- **Responsive UI**: Beautiful Material-UI design with loading states and animations
- **Conditional Rendering**: Only displays for projects with deployed splitter contracts

#### Technology Stack:
- **wagmi v1**: For Web3 hooks (`useContractRead`, `useContractWrite`, `usePrepareContractWrite`, `useWaitForTransaction`)
- **viem**: For ETH formatting utilities (`formatEther`)
- **Material-UI**: For professional UI components
- **react-hot-toast**: For user notifications

### 3. **Creator Dashboard Integration**
**File Modified:** `frontend/src/pages/CreatorDashboard.jsx`

- Imported the new `ProjectRevenueCard` component
- Added the component to the project rendering loop
- Each project card now shows an on-chain revenue card below it (if the project has a deployed contract)

---

## üîß How It Works

### User Flow:

1. **Creator Views Dashboard**: Creator navigates to their dashboard
2. **Wallet Connection**: Creator connects their Web3 wallet (MetaMask, etc.)
3. **Balance Display**: For each funded project with a deployed `VeriFundSplitter` contract:
   - The component reads the creator's pending payment from the blockchain
   - Displays the amount in ETH (with 6 decimal precision)
4. **Withdrawal Process**:
   - Creator clicks "Withdraw Funds to Wallet"
   - Transaction is prepared using `usePrepareContractWrite`
   - MetaMask (or connected wallet) prompts for transaction approval
   - Creator approves the transaction
   - Transaction is submitted to the blockchain
   - Component monitors transaction status
   - On confirmation, funds are transferred to the creator's wallet
   - Balance automatically updates to reflect the withdrawal

### Smart Contract Interaction:

```solidity
// Read function - no gas cost
function pendingPayment(address account) public view returns (uint256)

// Write function - requires gas
function release(address payable account) public nonReentrant whenNotPaused
```

## üß™ Testing Guide

### Prerequisites:

1. **Deployed Smart Contract**:
   - Ensure a `VeriFundSplitter` contract is deployed for a project
   - The project's `splitterContractAddress` field must be populated in the database

2. **Wallet Setup**:
   - MetaMask or compatible Web3 wallet installed
   - Wallet connected to the same network as the deployed contract (Sepolia testnet or Ethereum mainnet)
   - Wallet address should be one of the payees in the splitter contract

3. **Test ETH**:
   - The splitter contract should have some ETH balance
   - For testnet: Get Sepolia ETH from a faucet (https://sepoliafaucet.com/)

### Test Scenarios:

#### Scenario 1: View Pending Revenue
1. Navigate to Creator Dashboard
2. Connect your wallet
3. Find a project with a deployed splitter contract
4. Verify that the "On-Chain Revenue" card appears below the project card
5. **Expected**: The card displays the pending ETH amount (may be 0 if no revenue yet)

#### Scenario 2: Successful Withdrawal
1. Ensure the splitter contract has ETH and you have pending payment > 0
2. Click "Withdraw Funds to Wallet"
3. Approve the transaction in MetaMask
4. Wait for confirmation
5. **Expected**:
   - Toast shows "Preparing withdrawal transaction..."
   - Toast updates to "Waiting for wallet confirmation..."
   - Toast updates to "Transaction submitted! Waiting for confirmation..."
   - Toast shows success message with üéâ icon
   - Balance updates to 0 (or reduced amount if cap limited)
   - Your wallet balance increases by the withdrawn amount

#### Scenario 3: No Funds Available
1. Find a project where you have 0 pending payment
2. **Expected**:
   - Button is disabled
   - Button text reads "No Funds Available"
   - Clicking does nothing or shows "No funds available to withdraw" toast

#### Scenario 4: Wallet Not Connected
1. Disconnect your wallet
2. Navigate to Creator Dashboard
3. **Expected**:
   - On-chain revenue cards do not appear
   - Only standard project cards are visible

#### Scenario 5: Transaction Rejection
1. Click "Withdraw Funds to Wallet"
2. Reject the transaction in MetaMask
3. **Expected**:
   - Error toast appears
   - Card returns to normal state
   - Can retry the withdrawal

#### Scenario 6: Real-time Balance Updates
1. Have another address send ETH to the splitter contract
2. Wait a few seconds (contract polling interval)
3. **Expected**:
   - Balance automatically updates without page refresh
   - New pending amount is displayed

## üîç Technical Details

### Wagmi v1 Hooks Used:

1. **`useAccount`**: Get connected wallet address
2. **`useContractRead`**: Read `pendingPayment` from contract (with polling)
3. **`usePrepareContractWrite`**: Prepare the `release` transaction
4. **`useContractWrite`**: Execute the withdrawal transaction
5. **`useWaitForTransaction`**: Monitor transaction confirmation

### Security Features:

- **Pull-over-Push Pattern**: Smart contract requires users to initiate withdrawals (prevents forced transactions)
- **Reentrancy Protection**: Contract uses `ReentrancyGuard` modifier
- **Checks-Effects-Interactions**: Contract follows this pattern to prevent attacks
- **Gas Estimation**: Wagmi automatically estimates gas before transaction
- **User Confirmation**: All transactions require explicit wallet approval

### Error Handling:

- Graceful handling of wallet disconnection
- Clear error messages for failed transactions
- Automatic transaction retry capability
- Network error handling
- Contract interaction failures

## üöÄ Deployment Notes

### Environment Variables:
No new environment variables required. Uses existing wagmi configuration.

### Database Requirements:
Projects must have the `splitterContractAddress` field populated with a valid contract address.

### Network Configuration:
Ensure `frontend/src/services/wagmiConfig.js` is configured for the correct networks (Mainnet/Sepolia).

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No revenue card appears"
**Solutions:**
- Verify project has `splitterContractAddress` in database
- Check wallet is connected
- Ensure you're on the correct network

### Issue: "Transaction fails"
**Solutions:**
- Check you have enough ETH for gas fees
- Verify you're a payee in the contract
- Ensure contract is not paused
- Check network connection

### Issue: "Balance shows 0 but I should have funds"
**Solutions:**
- Verify the contract address is correct
- Check you're using the correct wallet address (same as registered payee)
- Inspect the contract on Etherscan to verify your share
- Wait for contract polling to update (a few seconds)

### Issue: "Stuck on 'Waiting for confirmation'"
**Solutions:**
- Check transaction status on Etherscan
- Wait longer (network congestion may delay)
- If transaction failed, try again with higher gas

## üë• Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check this documentation first
2. Review the smart contract code in `contracts/contracts/VeriFundSplitter.sol`
3. Check browser console for detailed error messages
4. Verify transaction on blockchain explorer

---

## üìù Code Example

Here's how the component is used in CreatorDashboard:

```jsx
{projects.map((project) => (
  <Grid item xs={12} sm={6} md={4} key={project._id}>
    <ProjectCard project={project} />
    
    {/* Automatically appears only if splitterContractAddress exists */}
    <ProjectRevenueCard project={project} />
  </Grid>
))}
```

The component is fully self-contained and requires only the `project` prop with a valid `splitterContractAddress`.

**Implementation Complete! üéâ**

The on-chain revenue and withdrawal feature is now fully functional and ready for testing.
