- Wrong user: "Not authorized to perform this action."
- Invalid project: "Project not found"
- Network error: "Failed to generate UPI QR code. Please try again."

## 🔍 Debugging Tips

### Check Backend Logs
Look for these console messages:
```
✅ UPI QR Code generated for project: [Project Name]
   Payout Amount: ₹[amount]
   Creator: [name]
```

### Check Frontend Console
Look for:
```javascript
🔍 UPI Response: { success: true, data: {...} }
```

### Check Network Tab (Browser DevTools)
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Click "Cash Out to UPI" → Select project
4. Find request: `GET /api/payout/upi-qr/[projectId]`
5. Check:
   - Status: 200 OK
   - Response has `upiString` field
   - Authorization header present

### Common Issues & Fixes

**Issue: Button is disabled**
- Fix: Create at least one project first
- Check: Projects array is not empty

**Issue: QR code not displaying**
- Fix: Check console for errors
- Verify: `qrcode.react` package is installed
- Check: `upiString` state is not null

**Issue: "Not authorized" error**
- Fix: Make sure you're logged in as the project creator
- Check: JWT token is valid and not expired
- Verify: `req.user.userId` matches `project.creator._id`

**Issue: Payout amount is ₹0.00**
- Fix: Add funding to the project
- Check: `project.currentFundingInr > 0`
- Formula: payoutAmount = currentFundingInr × 0.15
