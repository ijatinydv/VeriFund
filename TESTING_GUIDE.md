## üêõ Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue 1: "Project contract address not found"
**Cause**: Project doesn't have `splitterContractAddress`
**Fix**: Ensure project has deployed splitter contract before investing

### Issue 2: AI Suggestion returns very low/high prices
**Cause**: Backend algorithm is simplified for demo
**Fix**: Normal behavior - adjust algorithm in backend for production

### Issue 3: Transaction stuck on "Processing..."
**Cause**: Blockchain congestion or network issues
**Fix**: Wait longer or increase gas price in MetaMask

### Issue 4: Investment recorded twice
**Cause**: `useEffect` dependency issue
**Fix**: Check that `investmentRecorded` flag is working correctly

### Issue 5: Modal won't close after investment
**Cause**: State not properly reset
**Fix**: Verify `handleClose` function calls `resetTransaction()`
